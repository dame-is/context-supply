## AI Usage Environmental Impact Calculator

This tool helps you better understand the environmental impact of using AI by comparing it to everyday things that people can more easily relate to. The estimates are based on available research and can be toggled between pessimistic, neutral, or optimistic calculations.

### Key Points

- For most people, the impact of using AI is likely to be insignificant compared to other lifestyle factors
- However, for heavy AI users, the impact can be much more significant
- Data centers accounted for 1.5% of the world's electricity consumption in 2024, with AI usage being a subset of this
- The most impactful environmental actions for the average American remain:
  - Reducing or eliminating meat consumption (especially beef)
  - Voting for candidates who prioritize environmental issues

### Important Note

Determining the environmental impact of personal AI usage is complex and depends on various factors:
- Model version
- Configuration
- Query length
- Data center efficiency
- Regional energy sources

This tool is a work in progress and feedback is appreciated to help improve its accuracy and usefulness.

### Environmental Impact Statement

Even with individual lifestyle changes, preventing long-term ecological collapse will require significant changes from corporations and governments. Their actions and prioritization of non-renewable energy sources account for the vast majority of global emissions.
