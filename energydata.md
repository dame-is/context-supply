# Education

## Variables

- Longer inputs
- Longer outputs (reasoning models)
- Training (what's already been done in the past, not recurring)
- Hardware Construction (of the hardware used for training)
- Older models were less efficient, technology has improved

## Questions to ask yourself

- What about my internet usage?

Household leaks can waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water annually nationwide

The average household's leaks can account for nearly 10,000 gallons of water wasted every year


## International Energy Agency (IEA)

Today, electricity consumption from data centres is estimated to amount to around 415 terawatt hours (TWh), or about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024

Data centres accounted for around 1.5% of the worldâ€™s electricity consumption in 2024, or 415 terawatt-hours (TWh).

Our Base Case  finds that global electricity consumption for data centres is projected to double to reach around 945 TWh by 2030 in the Base Case, representing just under 3% of total global electricity consumption in 2030.

Data centres therefore account for a small share of emissions: 0.5% of combustion emissions today. [AI is a subset of data centre usage]
